# Using it

To use this, all you have to do is place a **RagePluginHook.log** file in the root folder. It uses logs to detect plugins.

Also make sure to add any plugins to **ids.json** if you want them to be checked. If there is no ID, it will be ignored. Id's can be found here:

Took me ~3 days to "complete". (AKA: Just write the PY file... Had some weird ways of getting the fileID that I just ditched and went to hardcoding them in a JSON file...)
