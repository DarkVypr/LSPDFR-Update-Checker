# Setting It Up

This program is relatively easy to set up. I personally just use it inside of VS code. If you don't know what VSC is/how to use it, that is on you to figure out. Once you have it opened in VS code, you can use the terminal to install these: `pip install requests packaging`.

If you have any further questions, make an issue here, or dm me on my LSPDFR profile. I will be adding to this readme with any steps that I forgot to state on setting this program up.

# Updating This Script

As I add new things, and develop new features to this program, you should naturally update it. Ironically, this update checker doesn't have an update checker, so you may need to check here periodically. I will eventually impliment some sort of version checker for this script; For now, it's just Coming Soonâ„¢...

# Checking a Log

To use this, all you have to do is place a **RagePluginHook.log** file in the root folder where the .py script file is. It uses logs to detect plugins[, and this is because it is meant to be mainly used on other's games. (LSPDFR support and yada-yada...)

# Options

In **config.json**, there are a few arrays which will affect how the program checks.

<h4><ins>Main</ins></h4>

The **"main"** array is used to specify some of the essential versions. These have to be manually updated each time their respective program is updated.

<h4><ins>Blacklist</ins></h4>

The **"blacklist"** array is used to blacklist a plugin which is either weirdly displayed (ie: "APIExample" and such...), or improperly versioned. For some reason, many plugin devs forget to update their assembly versions which causes the script to think that the plugin is outdated, when in reality it might be fine.

***Here is an example:***

![CodeRedCallouts' Bad Assembly Version](https://i.darkvypr.com/badplugin1.jpg)
![CodeRedCallouts' Version](https://i.darkvypr.com/badplugin2.jpg)

If you come across a plugin that is weird, just blacklist it.

<h4><ins>Hardcoded</ins></h4>

The **"hardcoded"** array is used for plugins that aren't on LCPDFR.com, and are widely used. An example of this is all of Bejoijo's plugins. It can also be used with plugins that use build numbers, *Section136Callouts* as an example.

<h4><ins>Deprecated</ins></h4>

The **"deprecated"** array is used for plugins that cause issues, are outdated and no longer supported, or have better alternatives. You can specify the reason for deprecation by adding a string to the JSON. If you would like no text, just put *null*. The text will show up right next to the plugin, example:

![Removal Example](https://i.darkvypr.com/removal-ex.jpg)

<h4><ins>Flags</ins></h4>

Finally the **"flags"** array is used to check the log for common issues. As you can see, in the JSON there are 2 properties. "r" is a shorthand for RegExp, and it's purpose is simple. Any expression that is put in this field will be tested against the user's log. If there is a match, this means that a common error was found, and the program will display this at runtime. Whatever is in the "desc" field will be displayed. Example:

# Adding an ID

In the **ids.json** file, the numbers next to all of the plugins correspond to the LCPDFR.com ID. The ID can be found here:

![LSPDFR ID location](https://i.darkvypr.com/lspdfr-id.jpeg)

Adding an ID is pretty self explanitory, just make sure that the plugin name is the same as the .dll name.

# RAGENativeUI Versions

This script will also attempt to find the version of RNUI installed. It kind works?... It requires a plugin to send the version inside of the log however. Popular callouts like Section136 and etc do this so it works 60% of the time.

# Results

Here is one of the various outputs you will see when checking a log:
